I can embed problems in <#942764372164481094>.
My command syntex (must include the "{}" around any data): 
```
command -flag{option}
-flag {data}
<attchment/image> 
```
Here is a list of options:
```
Commands:
"-help" - Shows this message
"-cool" - Embed and send problem to #cool-problems (Problem image should be attached with the command message)
"-rating" - Shows an estimated difficulty rating of some contests (Use it to estimate the difficulty of your problem)

Flags:
"-title" - (optional) An interesting title for the problem (Default: "Random Cool Problem")
"-hint" - (optional) Hint for the problem. Should be spoilered("|| spoiler ||")
"-source" - (optional) Source of the problem(spoiler)
"-difficulty" - (optional) Estimated difficulty of the problem(spoiler) [Use -rating to know about the difficulty scale and don't add it if you can't estimate the difficulty properly]
```
Must include image attachment of the problem.
```
Example:
-cool -title {Warrior Chess}
-difficulty{||5||}
-hint{||Coloring the board||}
-source{||BdMO 2019 HS P10||}
```
And you have to attach the problem as an Image with the message
